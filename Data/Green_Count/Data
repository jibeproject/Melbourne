I have used "Point along geometry " tool in qgis i.e. in step5 then picked some polygons to check if the gap of 50m was maintained or not on the polygon boundary .While doing so, I found the distance between first and last point is less than 50m . So, I have decided to remove those points and wrote and SQL query (see step 8)  to select those points and remove the last point to maintain the 50m gap along the perimeter of polygons.
