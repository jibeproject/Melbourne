I have categorised  and Merged FOI point features for individual, highstreet and negative attributes  These will then be clustered and joined to OSM spatially. 


 FOIs data have been enriched using OSM ( as shopping and other categories were missing from the FOI data as well).
 
 Here is the current categorization:

Individual points (postive) include: 

Land marks, sports and community venue, cafes pubs restaurants and recreational venues.

Negative points:

Power, storage facilities, bus stops (this is from the UK), vehicle service and inspection, emergency facility, and dirty places like brothel, strip club, casino and grave yard, 

Highstreet points:

Shopping and market places, convenience stores, banks and post offices.
