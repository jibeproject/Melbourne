I have categorised  and Merged FOI point features for individual, highstreet and negative attributes  These will then be clustered and joined to OSM spatially. 


 FOIs data have been enriched using OSM ( as shopping and other categories were missing from the FOI data as well).
 
 Here is the current categorization:

Individual points (postive) include: 

Land marks, sports and community venue, cafes pubs restaurants and recreational venues.

Negative points:

Power, storage facilities, bus stops (this is from the UK), vehicle service and inspection, emergency facility, and dirty places like brothel, strip club, casino and grave yard, 

Highstreet points:

Shopping and market places, convenience stores, banks and post offices.

Workflow>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Folders / steps numbered by step 1 to 4:


1. Points of interest feature is extracted from OSM using QGIS "QuickOSM" plug-in, and saved to local drive as a shapefile.
  The extracted shapefile is "OSM_Extract_AmenityFull.shp"

2. Points extracted from OSM are merged with Melbourne FOI dataset using R script "00_Process_OSM_RawExtraction.R". Output from this step, "Merged_FOI.csv" has coordinates and categorization of all points.

3. R script "01_ClassifyFOI.R"  reads "Merged_FOI.csv", and classifies all FOI points based on their original classification into three new categories: individual, negative and highstreet.

4. R script "02_SpatialClustering.R" clusters FOI points into clusters using k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) algorithm with the DBSCAN package. Outputs from this step are 3 csv files with coordinates of cluster centroids for individual, negative and highstreet layers.

5. QGIS "Join attributes by nearest" tool is used to find OSM links that are close to cluster centroids. A threshold distance of 800 meters is used in this step. Final output from this step are three shapefiles in "04_Results" folder.
