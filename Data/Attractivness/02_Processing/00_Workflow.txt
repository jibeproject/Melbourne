1. Points of interest feature is extracted from OSM using QGIS "QuickOSM" plug-in, and saved to local drive as a shapefile.
  The extracted shapefile is "OSM_Extract_AmenityFull.shp"

2. Points extracted from OSM are merged with Melbourne FOI dataset using R script "00_Process_OSM_RawExtraction.R". Output from this step, "Merged_FOI.csv" has coordinates and categorization of all points.

3. R script "01_ClassifyFOI.R"  reads "Merged_FOI.csv", and classifies all FOI points based on their original classification into three new categories: individual, negative and highstreet.

4. R script "02_SpatialClustering.R" clusters FOI points into clusters using k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) algorithm with the DBSCAN package. Outputs from this step are 3 csv files with coordinates of cluster centroids for individual, negative and highstreet layers.

5. QGIS "Join attributes by nearest" tool is used to find OSM links that are close to cluster centroids. A threshold distance of 800 meters is used in this step. Final output from this step are three shapefiles in "04_Results" folder.
